# Arduino-Sorter
#Objectives
Where Dal/Pulses is one of the major crops grown in India. There are almost 10-
15 different varieties of Dals which are grown and Flourish in India.

What if all of them are mixed with stones and you are told to sort them?
Now with the traditional sorter only a few units using dated technology-based
equipment, proper cleaning is not under, taken and acceptable products go into rejected
lots and between 5% - 8% wastage and tonne).

Thus there is a need for a new-age sorter thus we are introducing ML-Driven Sorter.
We will then cover how to use the images from the camera to create new classification
models using the Teachable Machine. Once we train the model, the sorter will be able
to classify and sort objects as they fall through the air, because of the Edge TPUâ€™s fast
inference time.
